# Artistic-Style-Transfer

This artistic style transfer model shown in the book "Practical Machine Learning with Python - A Problem-Solver's Guide to Building Real-World Intelligent Systems" by Dipanjan Sarkar, Raghav Bali and Tushar Sharma, was developed building the VGG-19 CNN with a batch of 3 images as input and loaded with pre-trained ImageNet weights without the top fully connected layers. The model learns and transfers the style of an image to another target image, creating awesome artistics results.
